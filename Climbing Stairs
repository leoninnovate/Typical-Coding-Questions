You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

class Solution:
    """
    @param n: An integer
    @return: An integer
    """
    def climbStairs(self, n):
        # write your code here
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        dp = [1 for i in xrange(n + 1)]
        for i in xrange(2, n + 1):
            dp[i] = dp[i - 2] + dp[i - 1]
        return dp[n]
