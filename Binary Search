Binary search is a famous question in algorithm.

For a given sorted array (ascending order) and a target number, find the first index of this number in O(log n) time complexity.

If the target number does not exist in the array, return -1.

Example
If the array is [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 10], for given target 3, return 2.

Challenge
If the count of numbers is bigger than MAXINT, can your code work properly?

    def binarySearch(self, nums, target):
        # write your code here
        if nums is None or len(nums) == 0:
            return -1
        start, end = 0, len(nums) - 1
        
        while start + 1 < end:
            mid = start + (end - start)/2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                end = mid
            elif nums[mid] < target:
                start = mid
            else:
                end = mid
        
        if nums[start] == target:
            return start
        if nums[end] == target:
            return end
        return -1
