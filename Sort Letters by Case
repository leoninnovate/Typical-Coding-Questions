Given a string which contains only letters. Sort it by lower case first and upper case second.

Note
It's not necessary to keep the original order of lower-case letters and upper case letters.

Example
For "abAcD", a reasonable answer is "acbAD"

Challenge
Do it in one-pass and in-place.

class Solution:
    """
    @param chars: The letters array you should sort.
    """
    def sortLetters(self, chars):
        # write your code here
        closed = -1
        for ind, val in enumerate(chars):
            if ord(val) < ord('a'):
                continue
            else:
                closed += 1
                chars[ind], chars[closed] = chars[closed], chars[ind]
