Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

For example,
Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2],
The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

class Solution:
    """
    @param num, a list of integer
    @return an integer
    """
    def longestConsecutive(self, num):
        # write your code here
        map = {x : 0 for x in num}
        res = 0
        for i in map:
            if not map[i]:
                curr = i + 1; len1 = 0
                while curr in map:
                    len1 += 1; map[curr] = 1; curr += 1
                curr = i - 1; len2 = 0
                while curr in map:
                    len2 += 1; map[curr] = 1; curr -= 1
                res = max(res, len1 + len2 + 1)
        return res
