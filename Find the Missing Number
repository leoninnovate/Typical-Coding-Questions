You are given a list of n-1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to n. There are no duplicates in list. One of the integers is missing in the list. Write an efficient code to find the missing integer.

Example:
I/P    [1, 2, 4, ,6, 3, 7, 8]
O/P    5

# Overflow problem
def getMissingNo(A, n):
    total = (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 2
    for i in xrange(n):
        total -= A[i]
    return total
    
# Using XOR
def getMissingNO(A, n):
    x1 = 0
    x2 = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        x1 ^= A[i]
    for j in xrange(n + 2):
        x2 ^= i
    return x1 ^ x2
