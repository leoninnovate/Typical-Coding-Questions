Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

Example
A = [2,3,1,1,4], return true.

A = [3,2,1,0,4], return false.

class Solution:
    # @param A, a list of integers
    # @return a boolean
    def canJump(self, A):
        # write your code here
        if A is None or len(A) == 0:
            return False
        size = len(A)
        for i in xrange(1, size):
            can = False
            for j in xrange(i):
                if A[j] + j >= i:
                    can = True
                    break
            if not can:
                return False
        return True
